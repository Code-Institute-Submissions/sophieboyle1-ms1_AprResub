### Project Creation

The project was started by navigating to the [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) and clicking 'Use this template'. Under Repository name I input MS1 and checked the Include all branches checkbox. I then navigated to the new repository. I then clicked the Code drop down and selected HTTPS and copied the link to the clipboard.

Opening a bash terminal in Visual studio code I then typed git clone link from clipboard followed by open folder and navigating to the newly created local repository. The following commands were used throughout the project:

* git add filename - This command was used to add fils to the staging area before commiting.
* git commit -m **commit message explaining the updates** - This command was used to to commit changes to the local repository.
* git push - This command is used to push all commited changes to the GitHub repository.

### Using Github Pages
* Navigate to the GitHub Repository:
* Click the 'Settings' Tab.
* Scroll Down to the Git Hub Pages Heading.
* Select 'Master Branch' as the source.
* Click the Save button.
* Click on the link to go to the live deployed page.

### Run Locally
* Navigate to the GitHub Repository:
* Click the Code drop down menu.
* Either Download the ZIP file, unpackage locally and open with IDE (This route ends here) OR Copy Git URL from the HTTPS dialogue box.
* Open your developement editor of choice and open a terminal window in a directory of your choice.
* Use the 'git clone' command in terminal followed by the copied git URL.
* A clone of the project will be created locally on your machine.
